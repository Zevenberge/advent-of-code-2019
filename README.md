# Advent of Code
The advent of code is an annual coding challenge. Every day, from the 1st of december until Christmas, a small coding puzzle appears online. It is a good opportunity to try new things in a small environment. I'm challenging myself to try 25 different languages this year.

1. Crystal
2. Haskell
3. Python
4. PHP
5. Ruby
6. Eiffel
7. Rust
8. F#
9. D
10. Kotlin
11. Clojure
12. OCaml
13. Bash
14. Go
15. Java
16. ~~Fortran~~ D
17. Nim
18. Zig
19. Ada
20. Julia
21. Scala
22. Erlang
23. Javascript
24. C#
25. D

Backup:
- Lua
- Assembly
- Janus
- Dart
- Prolog
- Pascal
- C
- Ballerina
- J
- ParaSail
- Smalltalk
- Forth

The list is subject to change if a problem is too hard to solve with the given language (I only have so much time in a day) or if I want to try a different language over one I already know (i.e. Kotlin over Javascript).
